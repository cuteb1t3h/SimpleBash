Hard frostand sunshine a day of pleasure!
You are still   drowsy at your leisure
It's time, m      y beauty, ope your eyes!
Let you get fre    e of blissful dreaming,
To meet the North Aurora, deeming

The Star of North, let you arise!


Last eve the blizzard howled angry,
The ghostly sky struck all and sundry,
T   he vapid moon wa    s scarcely seen
Among dark drear clouds









drifting;
        Your mood was cheerlessly shifting
Look now - what a change has been!
